# Rhred

Rhred is a command-line tool for securely deleting files and directories by overwriting them with random data. It uses the Rust programming language and the `rand` and `std` libraries.

## Usage

To use Rhred, run the program with a single argument: the path to the file or directory you want to shred. For example:

`rhed /path/to/file`

or

`rhed /path/to/directory`



Rhred will overwrite the file or all files in the directory with random data.
